# This file contains implementations for some common and useful
# quantum oracles. The way I'm going to define an oracle here is this:
# it's a function that takes in an arbitrary input qubit register and
# a single "result" qubit, runs some kind of code to check for a
# certain value or condition or something, and flips the result qubit
# if the input meets that condition / passes that check. Oracles are
# basically quantum "if-statements" that conform to a standard
# function signature.
# 
# The signature I'm describing here is called a "bit-flip" oracle,
# because it flips the result qubit if the input meets the specific
# condition the oracle checks for. This is usually the easiest way
# to write them from a conceptual understanding and maintainability
# perspective, and I have some utility functions in the utility
# module that convert them to other kinds of oracles automatically
# (like "phase-flip" ones, which are usually a lot more useful from
# an algorithm perspective).
# 
# Note that some oracles also take a context-specific argument that
# can provide some extra information the oracle needs in order to run.
